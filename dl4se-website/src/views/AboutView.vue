        The DL4SE tool allows to easily create large-scale datasets that can be used to either run
        MSR studies or to train DL models to automate SE tasks. Use our forms to define the
        characteristics of the dataset you would like to build. The question mark icons in the forms
        will guide you by providing explanations about the different filters you can use as well as
        processing operations that you can apply.

    <h3 class="page-section">How does it work?</h3>
    <div class="page-section">
      <p class="page-text">
        We continuously mine the source code of public GitHub repositories having at least 10 stars.
        While we acknowledge that the number of stars is not a good proxy of a repository's quality
        or relevance, we found the 10 stars threshold to be a reasonable mechanism to remove most of
        personal/toy projects unlikely to be relevant for empirical studies. Note that, since DL4SE
        continuously updates the information about the mined projects, a project excluded in the
        first place as having less than 10 stars can be mined a few days after once its number of
        stars reaches the set threshold. Also, the source code of the mined repositories is kept in
        line with its evolution on GitHub. This means that, pending a small time delay, you will
        always get fresh data as they appear in the projects' latest snapshot on GitHub.
      </p>
      <p class="page-text">
        Besides providing the source code of the mined projects, we also implemented several filters
        and processing steps frequently adopted in SE studies. For example, you can automatically
        remove from your dataset test code, unparsable code, or code including non-ASCII characters.
        You can exclude exact and near duplicates from your dataset, ask for an AST-based
        representation of each mined code instance, and much more!

    <h3 class="page-section">How long does it take to create a dataset?</h3>
    <div class="page-section">
      <p class="page-text">
        It depends on the size of the dataset and on the amount of requests running on our server.
        We allow for up to 10 requests to run in parallel. If there are no runners available when
        you submit your request, it will be queued until a runner is ready. You'll get an email as
        soon as your dataset is ready! In general, we do not expect the creation of a dataset to
        take more than 24 hours.

      <p class="page-text">The dataset will be provided in JSON format.</p>

    <h3 class="page-section">Why do you only support Java?</h3>
    <div class="page-section">
      <p class="page-text">
        This is only our first step. In the next months we plan to integrate Python, C/C++, and
        Javascript. Also, we will expand the types of datasets that can be built, providing forms
        specialized for the creation of datasets to automate code summarization and code review.
